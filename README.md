1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?
2. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?

Answers:
  1. Task should be a Class, due to the flexibility it allows for future additions. Forcing Task to be a class also allows the project to focus on a object orientated coding
  2. Future enhancements might be Task List Formatting and setting Task due dates. Forcing Task to be a class allows for these additions to be implemented easier, thus our answer should not change.
